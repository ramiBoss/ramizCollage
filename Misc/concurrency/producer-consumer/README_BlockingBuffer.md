# Enhanced BlockingBuffer Producer-Consumer Implementation

This is a modernized and improved version of the classic Producer-Consumer pattern using Java's `ArrayBlockingQueue` for thread-safe communication.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### **1. BlockingBuffer.java**
- **Thread-safe operations** with comprehensive error handling
- **Configurable buffer capacity** with validation
- **Statistics tracking** (items produced/consumed, timing)
- **Timeout support** for non-blocking operations
- **Detailed logging** and monitoring capabilities
- **Performance metrics** and buffer state information

### **2. Producer.java**
- **Configurable production parameters** (items count, sleep time)
- **Named producers** for better debugging
- **Statistics tracking** (production time, success rate)
- **Proper interrupt handling** and graceful shutdown
- **Comprehensive error logging**

### **3. Consumer.java**
- **Data validation and processing** with sum calculation
- **Configurable consumption parameters**
- **Value storage** for verification and analysis
- **Advanced statistics** (average values, timing)
- **Interrupt-safe operations**

### **4. Enhanced Test Suite**
- **Multiple test scenarios** (basic, multi-threaded, capacity)
- **Performance monitoring** with timing metrics
- **Graceful shutdown** with timeout handling
- **Comprehensive output** with statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### Compile the code:
```bash
cd /Users/ramizkhan/Documents/GitHub/ramizCollage/Misc
javac *.java
```

### Run the enhanced test:
```bash
java BlockingBufferTest
```

### Expected Output:
```
=== BlockingBuffer Producer-Consumer Test ===

üß™ Running Basic Test (1 Producer, 1 Consumer)
Buffer capacity: 5

Producer writes  1 | Buffer occupied: 1/5 | Wait time: 0ms
Consumer reads   1 | Buffer occupied: 0/5 | Wait time: 2ms
		[Consumer-1] Running sum: 1
Producer writes  2 | Buffer occupied: 1/5 | Wait time: 0ms
...

[Producer-1] Production completed!
  ‚Ä¢ Items produced: 10/10
  ‚Ä¢ Total time: 2147 ms
  ‚Ä¢ Average time per item: 0.30 ms

[Consumer-1] Consumption completed!
  ‚Ä¢ Items consumed: 10/10
  ‚Ä¢ Final sum: 55
  ‚Ä¢ Average value: 5.50
  ‚Ä¢ Total time: 1876 ms
  ‚Ä¢ Average time per item: 0.20 ms

‚úÖ Basic test completed in 2150 ms

========================
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Buffer Configuration
```java
// Default buffer (capacity = 1)
BlockingBuffer buffer = new BlockingBuffer();

// Custom capacity
BlockingBuffer buffer = new BlockingBuffer(10);
```

### Producer Configuration
```java
// Default producer
Producer producer = new Producer(buffer);

// Custom configuration
Producer producer = new Producer(buffer, 20, 1000, "MyProducer");
//                               items, maxSleepMs, name
```

### Consumer Configuration
```java
// Default consumer
Consumer consumer = new Consumer(buffer);

// Custom configuration
Consumer consumer = new Consumer(buffer, 20, 500, "MyConsumer");
//                               items, maxSleepMs, name
```

## üìà Performance Features

### Timeout Operations
```java
// Non-blocking offer with timeout
boolean success = buffer.offer(value, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

// Non-blocking poll with timeout
Integer value = buffer.poll(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

### Buffer Monitoring
```java
int size = buffer.size();                    // Current buffer size
int capacity = buffer.capacity();            // Maximum capacity
int remaining = buffer.remainingCapacity();  // Available space
boolean empty = buffer.isEmpty();            // Is buffer empty?
boolean full = buffer.isFull();             // Is buffer full?
```

### Statistics Access
```java
long produced = buffer.getTotalItemsProduced();
long consumed = buffer.getTotalItemsConsumed();
buffer.printStatistics();  // Detailed statistics output
```

## üéØ Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Test**: Single producer and consumer with standard configuration
2. **Multi-threaded Test**: Multiple producers and consumers working concurrently
3. **Capacity Test**: Small buffer to demonstrate blocking behavior
